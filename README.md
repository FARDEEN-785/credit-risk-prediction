# Credit Risk Prediction System (MLOps)

A production-grade end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting credit default risk, built with modern MLOps practices.  
The system covers the full ML lifecycle: data processing, model training, experiment tracking, model registry, and API-based deployment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on demographic, financial, and credit history features.  
Multiple models were trained and evaluated, with the best-performing model deployed as a REST API.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → API)
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Production-ready inference API

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

- **Programming**: Python  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **MLOps**: MLflow (tracking, registry)  
- **API**: FastAPI, Uvicorn  
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall  

---

## 📊 Models Used

- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- XGBoost Classifier (final model)

**XGBoost achieved higher recall (~71%)**, making it more effective at identifying high-risk borrowers.

## 🧪 Experiment Tracking

MLflow is used to:
- Track experiments and metrics
- Compare multiple models
- Register the best-performing model

> Note: MLflow artifacts (`mlruns/`) are generated locally at runtime and are excluded from version control.

🔑 Key Insight
Gradient-boosted models captured non-linear patterns in credit data better than linear models, significantly improving recall for default prediction — a critical metric in real-world credit risk systems.

📈 Future Improvements
Data drift and model monitoring

Automated retraining pipelines
